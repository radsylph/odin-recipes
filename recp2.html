    <hr>

    <strong>Preparations:</strong>

    <li>
        1. Place the whole unpeeled potatoes in a pot with plenty of water and a little salt. Cook until soft, 
        about 30-40 minutes depending on size. I usually try to poke a knife through the middle to check for 
        doneness.

        2. Put the potatoes in a bowl of cold water to cool them and then proceed to peel them and cut them into small 
        or medium chunks.

        3. To cook prepare the hard-boiled eggs, bring water to a boil in a medium sized saucepan. Then gently add the 
        eggs. Let the eggs cook in the boiling water for 10 minutes, then transfer them to a bowl with cold water until 
        you are ready to peel them.

        4. I recommend saving one of the eggs to use as a garnish for the salad. 
        Peel and then dice the rest of the hard-boiled eggs.

        6. To prepare the dressing, mix the mayonnaise (or yogurt) with the mustard, vinegar, salt and pepper. 
        Pour this dressing on top of the chopped potatoes/eggs and mix well.

        7. Taste the salad and adjust the amount of salt/pepper to taste. Add the chopped dill and paprika. If you saved 
        one of the hard-boiled eggs, cut it into quarters or slices and use them to decorate the salad. The salad can be
        served on top of lettuce leaves.
