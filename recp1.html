<strong>Preparations</strong>

<p>For the arepa:</p>
<ul> 1. Place the warm water in a mixing bowl. Then add the salt, and a tablespoon of oil, stir. Add the flour, 
    stirring constantly with a spoon. Knead until you get a nice smooth consistency, without lumps. The 
    dough should release easily from the bowl.</ul>

<ul> 2. Divide the dough into six equal-sized balls and form the arepas by flattening them between your hands. 
    Spread the remaining tablespoon of oil over the surface of a skillet.</ul>

<ul>
    3. Turn on the stove to medium high heat, and place the arepas to cook covered, with enough separation 
    between each other (to be able to turn them easily). When the first five minutes have passed, turn 
    them over and cook them covered another five minutes on the opposite side. Remove them and let them 
    rest.</ul>

<p>For the stuffing:</p>
<ul>
    1. While the arepas are cooking. Peel the avocado, reserve at least 25% of it to serve cut into slices 
    inside the arepas, and mash the rest. Cut the other part of the avocado into thin slices. To prevent the 
    avocado from turning black, you can sprinkle with a few drops of lemon.
</ul>

<ul>
    2. Cut the onion and cilantro, finely. Crush the garlic clove. Place the dressings in a bowl and mix 
    with the olive oil, lemon juice, salt and mayonnaise. Pour the mashed avocado into the bowl with the 
    mayonnaise and stir until a smooth paste forms.
</ul>

<ul>
    3. Add the shredded chicken. With a wooden spoon mix everything. Taste and adjust salt if necessary. 
    With a sharp knife, open the arepas, remove excess dough, and fill to your liking. Remember to leave a 
    little space to place some avocado slices.
</ul>
